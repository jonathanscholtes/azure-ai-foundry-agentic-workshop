### üß† Build Smart, Actionable AI with Azure AI Agent Service (Portal)

The [Azure AI Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview) is a fully managed platform designed to help developers create intelligent, context-aware agents‚Äîwithout the overhead of managing compute or storage infrastructure. These agents are extensible, secure, and capable of reasoning over documents and interacting with external APIs.

In this walkthrough, you'll build an AI agent that performs two key tasks:
- Retrieves contextual information from **Azure AI Search**
- Executes real-time actions via an **OpenAPI** endpoint to surface structured data like energy usage from a data center

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Creating a New Azure AI Agent

Let‚Äôs walk through how to set up an agent that combines knowledge retrieval and dynamic API interaction.



##### 1. Create a New Agent

In your **AI Project** within Azure AI Foundry, navigate to the **Agents** section and click **+ Create Agent**.

![Create New Agent](../media/agents/new_agent.png)

---

##### 2. Define Your Agent‚Äôs Role and Instructions

Provide your agent with a clear name and set of instructions. Here‚Äôs an example configuration:

> You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant specializing in data center energy usage.  
> Use two primary sources to answer questions:  
> - `workshop-index` for documents and research insights  
> - `energyusage` for tabular and numerical data  
> Always use the available context when forming a response. If the information is not found, politely inform the user that the answer isn‚Äôt currently available.

![Agent Configuration](../media/agents/data_center_agent.png)

---

##### 3. Add a Knowledge Source

To enable contextual awareness, add **Azure AI Search** as a knowledge source. This allows the agent to pull insights directly from your indexed documents.

<img src="../media/agents/agent_knowledge.png" alt="Add Knowledge Source" style="height:100px; width:auto;">

- Click **+ Add** under **Knowledge**
- Select **Azure AI Search**
- Use an existing index or connect a new one via your Azure AI Search connection

---

##### 4. Add an Action via OpenAPI

Let‚Äôs give your agent the power to call an API. This could be to retrieve structured data or even trigger external workflows.

<img src="../media/agents/agent_action.png" alt="Add Action" style="height:100px; width:auto;">

- Click **+ Add** under the **Actions** section
- Select **OpenAPI-specified tool**

<img src="../media/agents/openapi_action.png" alt="OpenAPI Tool Selection" style="height:50px; width:auto;">

- Provide a meaningful **name** and **description** for your tool

<img src="../media/agents/tool_details.png" alt="Tool Details" style="height:350px; width:auto;">

To retrieve and apply your OpenAPI schema:

1. Visit the API documentation:  
   `https://api-foundry-lab-[random].azurewebsites.net/docs` - _replace with your deployed endpoint url_
2. Click on **/openapi.json**
3. Copy the full JSON schema
4. Paste it into the tool creation window

<img src="../media/agents/openapi_docs.png" alt="OpenAPI Docs" style="height:100px; width:auto;">
<img src="../media/agents/agent_tool_schema.png" alt="Tool Schema" style="height:350px; width:auto;">

---

##### 5. üß™ Test the Agent in Playground

Once your agent is configured with both knowledge and actions, test it using the **Playground** feature.

<img src="../media/agents/agent_try_playground.png" alt="Try in Playground" style="height:350px; width:auto;">

Try asking:

> **"What data centers are in 'critical'?"**  
The agent will use the OpenAPI action to retrieve structured usage data.

<img src="../media/agents/agent_playground_critical_lookup.png" alt="Critical Lookup" style="height:350px; width:auto;">

Or:

> **"What are the Data Center Space Types?"**  
This will perform vector-based retrieval over your indexed documents in Azure AI Search.

<img src="../media/agents/agent_playground_data_center_space_lookup.png" alt="Space Type Lookup" style="height:350px; width:auto;">

---

By combining the best of vector search and API-based action execution, you're creating intelligent agents that don‚Äôt just talk‚Äîthey **do**.
