## Deployment: Azure AI Foundry and Dependencies

This section provides a detailed guide for deploying Azure AI Foundry and the associated dependencies required for the workshop. We will walk you through the necessary prerequisites and the steps to successfully configure your environment.

You will clone the repository, deploy the solution using either PowerShell or Bash, and set up the essential resources needed to implement multi-agent systems.

#### Key Resources Deployed:
- **Azure AI Foundry** components: AI Service, AI Hub, Projects, and Compute  
- **Azure AI Search** for knowledge retrieval and vector-based search  
- **Azure Storage Account** for document storage and data ingestion  
- **Azure Functions** for event-driven document chunking, embedding generation, and indexing  
- **Azure Web App** to enable agent interactions via OpenAPI and GraphQL integrations

--- 

### **Prerequisites**
Before diving into deployment, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place to ensure a smooth setup:
- âœ… **Azure Subscription:** Active subscription with sufficient privileges to create and manage resources.  
- âœ… **Azure CLI:** Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) for managing Azure resources.  
- âœ… **IDE with Bicep & PowerShell Support:** Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the **Bicep extension** for development and validation.  

---

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanscholtes/azure-ai-foundry-agentic-workshop.git

cd azure-ai-foundry-agentic-workshop
```


### 2. Deploy the Solution  

#### ðŸ”¹ PowerShell (Windows)

Run the following PowerShell command to deploy the solution. Replace the placeholders with your actual subscription name and Azure region. The `-ResourceGroupName` flag is optional for deploying to an exising Azure Resource Group:

```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 -Subscription '[Subscription Name]' -Location 'eastus2' -DevComputeInstances 1 -ResourceGroupName '[Name of existing resource group (optional)]'
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Bash (Linux)

Run the following commands in your terminal to deploy the solution.
Make sure the deployment script is executable and that you're authenticated with Azure.
The third argument (resource group name) is optional.

```bash

# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

chmod +x scripts/deploy_functionapp.sh

# Authenticate with Azure
az login
# or use
az login --identity

# Set the active subscription
az account set --subscription '[Subscription Name]'

# Deploy the solution to the secified Location, with DevComputeInstances
./deploy.sh 'eastus2' 1 '[Existing Resource Group Name (optional)]'
```

âœ… This script provisions all required Azure resources based on the specified parameters. The deployment may take up to **20 minutes** to complete.



### 3. ðŸ“¥ Upload Structured Data for Agent Integration

After completing the deployment, you will need to update the sample dataset for the agent integration.

1. Upload the **parquet** data file to the `data` container in the Azure Storage Account.
    1.1 The demonstration utilizes synthetic data related to data center energy usage.
