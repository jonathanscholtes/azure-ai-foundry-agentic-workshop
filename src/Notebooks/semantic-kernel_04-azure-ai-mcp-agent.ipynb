      "   - Defined as the total electricity demand of the data center divided by the electricity demand of the IT equipment.\n",

      "2. **Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)**:\n",
      "   - Defined as the total water consumption of the data center divided by the electricity demand of the IT equipment.\n",

      "Other notes:\n",
      "- Operational characteristics, cooling systems, and infrastructure equipment are simulated using thermodynamic models to predict overall PUE and WUE averages.\n",
