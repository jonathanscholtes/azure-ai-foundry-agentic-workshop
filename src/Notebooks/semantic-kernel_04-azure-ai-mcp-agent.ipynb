      "The resource intensity of data center facility infrastructure is often assessed using metrics such as **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)** and **Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**: Measures the total facility electricity consumption versus the electricity demand of IT equipment. It is a dimensionless ratio (kWh/kWh) representing the efficiency of energy use in a data center.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)**: Quantifies the total water consumption (in liters per kWh) used by the data center relative to the electricity demand of IT equipment. This metric is particularly influenced by cooling infrastructure and operational practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key contributors to these metrics include:\n",
      "- **Cooling systems**: The efficiency and type of cooling systems implemented (e.g., air-cooled, liquid cooling).\n",
      "- **Operational practices**: How efficiently the data center is operated.\n",
      "- **Climate conditions**: Local environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and water availability.\n",
      "- **Size and type of data centers**: Small, mid-sized, or large-scale spaces (e.g., hyperscale, colocation).\n",
      "\n",
      "Resource intensity factors also extend to indirect consumption impacts, such as water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions tied to electricity generation. For example:\n",
      "- Average indirect **water consumption** intensity in U.S. data centers (2023): ~4.52 liters per kilowatt-hour (L/kWh).\n",
      "- Average **GHG emission intensity** in U.S. data centers (2023): ~0.34 kg CO₂ equivalent per kilowatt-hour.\n",
