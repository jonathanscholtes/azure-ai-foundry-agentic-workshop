# Azure AI Foundry Workshop: Vector Search, Agentic AI, and LLM Orchestration

## Overview  

An **Azure Ai Foundry** interactive workshop aimed at introducing concepts like **Vector Search**, **Agentic AI**, and **Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration**. This project enables participants to gain practical experience integrating and deploying generative AI models, orchestrating tasks with **LangChain**, implementing **Vector Search** using **Azure AI Search**, and developing multi-agent systems for collaborative and intelligent task execution.


#### Key Features  

- **Azure AI Foundry Deployment:**  
  - Deploys **AI Hub**, **AI Project**, and **AI Services** with secure access and managed identities for integration with AI models.  

- **Vector Search with Azure AI Search:**  
  - Implements **Vector Search** to enable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using indexed embeddings from documents.  

- **Agentic AI Framework:**  
  - Leverages **Agentic AI** patterns to enable task orchestration and decision-making workflows.  

- **LLM Orchestration with LangChain:**  
  - Integrates **LangChain** for seamless orchestration of large language models (LLMs).  
  - Enables flexible **multi-agent systems** for complex problem solving, supporting dynamic decision-making and workflow automation.
