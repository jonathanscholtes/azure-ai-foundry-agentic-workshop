# Azure AI Foundry Workshop: Vector Search, Agentic AI, and LLM Orchestration

## Overview  

An **Azure Ai Foundry** interactive workshop aimed at introducing concepts like **Vector Search**, **Agentic AI**, and **Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration**. This project enables participants to gain practical experience integrating and deploying generative AI models, orchestrating tasks with **LangChain**, implementing **Vector Search** using **Azure AI Search**, and developing multi-agent systems for collaborative and intelligent task execution.


#### Key Features  

- **Azure AI Foundry Deployment:**  
  - Deploys **AI Hub**, **AI Project**, and **AI Services** with secure access and managed identities for integration with AI models.  

- **Vector Search with Azure AI Search:**  
  - Implements **Vector Search** to enable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using indexed embeddings from documents.  

- **Agentic AI Framework:**  
  - Leverages **Agentic AI** patterns to enable task orchestration and decision-making workflows.  

- **LLM Orchestration with LangChain:**  
  - Integrates **LangChain** for seamless orchestration of large language models (LLMs).  
  - Enables flexible **multi-agent systems** for complex problem solving, supporting dynamic decision-making and workflow automation.


## üõ†Ô∏è **Core Steps for Solution Implementation**

Follow these key steps to successfully implement and deploy the solution:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [**Workshop Setup and Solution Deployment**](docs/deployment.md)  
Step-by-step instructions to deploy **Azure AI Foundry** and all required services for the workshop environment, including:

- **Azure AI Foundry** components: AI Service, AI Hub, Projects, and Compute  
- **Azure AI Search** for knowledge retrieval and vector-based search  
- **Azure Storage Account** for document storage and data ingestion  
- **Azure Functions** for event-driven document chunking, embedding generation, and indexing  
- **Azure Web App** to enable agent interactions via OpenAPI and GraphQL integrations

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [**Vector Search and RAG Setup**](docs/vector-search.md)  
Instructions for processing documents and creating embeddings using **Ada-002**, indexing them into **Azure AI Search**, and configuring **RAG** for semantic retrieval.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [**Explore Sample Notebooks**](docs/notebooks.md)  
Get hands-on experience with **Agentic AI** through a collection of curated sample notebooks. These examples demonstrate:

- Vector search and semantic retrieval using Azure AI Search  
- Multi-agent orchestration integrating structured data via OpenAPI and GraphQL  
- Real-world Agentic AI patterns implemented with Azure AI Foundry Agents
