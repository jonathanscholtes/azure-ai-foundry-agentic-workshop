# Azure AI Foundry Workshop: Vector Search, Agentic AI, and LLM Orchestration

## Overview  

This project provides the **Azure AI Foundry** deployment as part of an interactive workshop aimed at introducing advanced concepts like **Vector Search**, **Agentic AI**, and **Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration**. The solution is designed to help participants learn how to integrate and deploy generative AI models, orchestrate tasks using **LangChain** and **Semantic Kernel**, and implement **Vector Search** with **Azure AI Search**.

The deployment incorporates cutting-edge techniques for AI-driven automation and orchestration using multiple AI agents working together to perform intelligent tasks.

#### Key Features  

- **Azure AI Foundry Deployment:**  
  - Deploys **AI Hub**, **AI Project**, and **AI Services** with secure access and managed identities for integration with AI models.  

- **Vector Search with Azure AI Search:**  
  - Implements **Vector Search** to enable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using indexed embeddings from documents.  

- **Agentic AI Framework:**  
  - Leverages **Agentic AI** patterns to enable task orchestration and decision-making workflows.  
  - Deploys autonomous agents capable of interacting with Azure services to complete tasks.

- **LLM Orchestration with LangChain & Semantic Kernel:**  
  - Integrates **LangChain** and **Semantic Kernel** for seamless orchestration of large language models (LLMs) in a modular fashion.  
  - Enables flexible **multi-agent systems** for complex problem solving, supporting dynamic decision-making and workflow automation.
